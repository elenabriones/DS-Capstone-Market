En este ejemplo, se agruparán semanalmente ('W') y el doming ('sun') será el día de inicio de la semana."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["(8354260, 10)"]},"execution_count":123,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["df_weekly_sales.shape"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 8354260 entries, 0 to 8354259\n","Data columns (total 10 columns):\n"," #   Column      Dtype         \n","---  ------      -----         \n"," 0   id          object        \n"," 1   item        object        \n"," 2   category    object        \n"," 3   department  object        \n"," 4   store       object        \n"," 5   store_code  object        \n"," 6   region      object        \n"," 7   date        datetime64[ns]\n"," 8   qty_sold    int64         \n"," 9   yearweek    int64         \n","dtypes: datetime64[ns](1), int64(2), object(7)\n","memory usage: 637.4+ MB\n"]}],"source":["df_weekly_sales.info()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Union Weekly Sales con Prices"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["df_merged_final= pd.merge(df_weekly_sales, df_prices, on=['id', \"yearweek\"], how='left')  "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 8354260 entries, 0 to 8354259\n","Data columns (total 11 columns):\n"," #   Column      Dtype         \n","---  ------      -----         \n"," 0   id          object        \n"," 1   item        object        \n"," 2   category    object        \n"," 3   department  object        \n"," 4   store       object        \n"," 5   store_code  object        \n"," 6   region      object        \n"," 7   date        datetime64[ns]\n"," 8   qty_sold    int64         \n"," 9   yearweek    int64         \n"," 10  sell_price  float64       \n","dtypes: datetime64[ns](1), float64(1), int64(2), object(7)\n","memory usage: 701.1+ MB\n"]}],"source":["df_merged_final.info()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["df_merged_final.to_csv((ruta+'df_merged.csv'), index=False)"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyPJvXBLJBbXI3gOcFa4TdiK","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
